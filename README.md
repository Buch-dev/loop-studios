## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt a lot on CSS Grid: on how to place sections on each other accordingly

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to dedicate more time learning and practising CSS Grid, solving complex layouts with CSS Grid and making use of Media Queries efficiently.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell CSS Grid Tutorial] - This helped me for the Grid Section. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
